
### Description
This is a Matlab implementation of 3D-finite-element-method for beams.
FEM calculates the bending moments, shear force and deflection accurately.
The code is verified with the analytical solution.

### Introduction

All codes are available inside the Code directory.

Folder 1:  Swing structural analysis.
        The code here is for the computation the swing structure without distributed load.

Folder 2:  Verification with a cantilever.
        The code here is the program with distributed load. The input are the verification example -- one simple cantilever. 

Folder 3:  Swing structural analysis with distributed load
        The code here is the program with distributed load. 

In each folder, just run "main", then, the result will show.
